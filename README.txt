@hackpgh @wiglewhiskey #whiskey

PREEMPTIVE DUNKING

$ sudo dunk_right.py     fires the horn and right feathers & water
$ sudo dunk_left.py      fires the horn and left feathers & water
$ sudo dunk_both.py      fires the horn and both feathers & water

(Note, intent is for whiskey to be left, taxes right)

GOTCHA:  If you preemptively run dunk_right/left/both before the game ends,
         you must control-c to kill the running game.
